                            <h5>ArcGIS:</h5>
                            <p>We located the data we wanted to use in our project and ensured it properly loaded into ArcGIS. The data can be viewed under the data webpage.<br></p>
                            <h5>Website</h5>
                            <p>We created general templates to use in our website. We created 3 pages, our progress, the problem and data. Our website is being designed to be dynamically sized and mobile responsive.<br></p>
                            <h5>Plan</h5>
                            <p>The direct next steps will be to import our data fully into an ArcGis project and start manipulating it. We will then add our results to the webpage and fully document the data.</p>
                            <p>The steps we need to take in ArcGIS are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Convert our contour into an aspect raster to eliminate north facing slopes from selection</li>
                                <li>Set a buffer around power lines that have a high increased power capability to find areas only surrounding those lines</li>
                                <li>Perform raster calculations to merge datasets together to create an overall score for solar panel compatibility factoring in sunshine, influence on wildlife and forestry</li>
                                <li>Filter out areas not in our area of study or areas not compatible for solar panels</li>
                                <li>Query only areas of a large enough area that are high quality locations for solar panels</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h5>ArcGIS:</h5>
                            <p>We successfully performed and automated the following data processes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Convert our DEM data into an aspect raster and reclassify its values such that South is equal to 1 and North is 0. </li>
                                <li>Convert our ecological zone data into raster and reclassify its value such that the minimum is 0 (not ideal) and maximum is 1 (ideal).</li>
                                <li>Set a buffer around power lines with high power capability.</li>
                                <li>Created thiessen polygon's surrounding power substations. Associated each polygon with a value between 0 and 1 with 1 being a high ability to transmit more power and converted to raster data.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We are still in the process of calculating the annual solar radiation in the areas we are interested as it is a time consuming task due to the size of the data.<br></p>
                            <h5>Website</h5>
                            <p>We updated our results page with screenshots of the results of the data processing we have done so far.<br></p>
                            <h5>Plan</h5>
                            <p>Once we complete all the data processing and automation, we will be publishing the results on ArcGIS Online. We also expect to have created a Story Map by the next update.<br></p>

                            <p>We successfully performed all geoprocessing tasks required for our map. A final layer was created with a variety of different styling options based on use.<br></p>
                            <p>ArcGIS online was incorporated into our final solution by storing layouts for our data and layers of our results.</p>
                            <p>ArcGIS story builder was used to create a start to finish display of our project and embedded onto our website.</p>
                            <p>The model builder was updated with every process used. It was then split into two sections, processing data and combining data.</p>
                            <h5>Website</h5>
                            <p>We finished the analysis page and created and finished the results page.<br></p>
                            <p>All pages were tested to ensure our mobile responsiveness was functioning as intended.</p>
