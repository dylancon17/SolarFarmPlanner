                                Our Problem: How to Identify Ideal Locations to Build Solar Panel Farms
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                <br>There is a current shift in our world to transition to more renweable energy sources. One of these increasingly used technologies is solar panel farms. In Alberta, there is currently 24 major farms generating energy for us Albertans. Many more are under construction including Travers solar which will include 1.3million solar panels.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our goal with this project is to identify ideal locations for future solar panel farm installations. A critical part of solar panel farms is to install in locations with high average sunlight and minimized shading throughout the course of the year. The location can make or break the effectiveness of the solar panels so proper care must be taken in selecting our location.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To identify ideal locations, there are a variety of factors to consider. Most importantly, we have to ensure that the amount of sunlight they can receive is maximized. This will come from identifying flat slopes or slopes that face directly South. A secondary goal of the project is to identify locations that have pre-existing infrastructure to handle an increase of power in their energy systems. That factor will be considered in order to minimize start-up costs and to make the project more attainable. Other factors we will consider will include our tree converage, number of sunny days and proximity to cities which consume the most power.

                                For our project, we will analyze the prairie ecozone of Alberta. This is in the South East part of Alberta. We chose the prairie area as it is generally open and relatively flat which will make it more compatible with solar panel locations. We specifically chose Alberta due to how rapidly the industry is expanding around us.
